# SUDOC Toolbox BETA
A range of tools for interacting with the SUDOC from Alma.

## List of PPNs : xtracts PPNs from a list of results.
The <i>List of PPNs</i> service extracts PPNs from search results for reuse in a WinibW search, a Qualimarc analysis or in a file.

## Multiwhere : Number of locations in SUDOC
The 'Multiwhere' service indicates the number of SUDOC establishments located under each title in the list of search results. It is based on the SUDOC web service of the same name.

## SynchroSudoc : Synchronization analysis for ILN
'Synchro SUDOC' service , indicates, for each title in the list of search results, whether the modification date of the record in Alma is well above the modification date of the record in the SUDOC and displays all locations for the ILN declared in the configuration parameters.

## Choose your ILN
To change the ILN value, go to configuration menu. You need to have 'Repository Administrator', 'Acquisitions Administrator', 'Catalog Administrator' or 'General System Administrator' rights. If you do not have this level of authorization, please contact your Alma administrator.
